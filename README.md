# Graduation Trends in U.S. Universities

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes graduation trends in U.S. universities, focusing on key institutional factors such as **public vs. private control, HBCU vs. non-HBCU status, and location**. The dataset includes all degrees awarded between **July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021**, covering approximately **4.84 million graduates**. The goal is to understand how different university types serve diverse student populations and identify patterns in degree attainment across **gender, ethnicity, and institutional classification**.  

## Key Findings  
- **Gender Trends**: Women receive nearly **twice as many degrees as men**, with high enrollment in online and flexible degree programs.  
- **Ethnicity Trends**: Minority students are more likely to graduate from **private for-profit institutions**, but there are **no private-for-profit HBCUs**.  
- **Geographic Patterns**: States with the highest minority graduate populations include **Arizona, Texas, California, Florida, and Maryland**.  
- **HBCUs vs. Non-HBCUs**: HBCUs continue to play a significant role in supporting Black students, while other minority groups tend to enroll in non-HBCU institutions.  
- **International Students**: Non-U.S. residents prefer **private not-for-profit institutions**, particularly those in metropolitan areas with strong international support services.  

## Data Sources  
- Graduation data from U.S. universities (2020-2021)  
- Institutional classifications (public/private, HBCU status)  
- Demographic breakdown by **gender and ethnicity**
